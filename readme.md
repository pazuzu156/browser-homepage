Scara is a PHP MVC Framework built to be lightweight and simple to use.

## What is this?
It's an MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework built in PHP from scratch. Why build one if there are already others out there? 2 reasons..

1. Dive head-first into building a large-scale application framework
2. To serve the needs of what I need it for, and change it in any capacity as I see fit.

## Can I use it now?
Yes. Version 1.0 is Scara's first stable release. It should be ready for use now. If you find any bugs, please [report them](https://github.com/ScaraMVC/Scara/issues).
